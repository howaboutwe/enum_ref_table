 * Memoize enum_table list. Your logs are now less noisy.
 * #enum no longer requires the table to exist when migrating or loading the
   schema, so migrations have a chance to create the enum tables.

 * DB Nazi compliance.
 * Remove customizability of the foreign key, since ActiveRecord mangles these
   customizations when roundtripped through schema.rb.
